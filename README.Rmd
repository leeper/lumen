# Lumen Database API Client #

**lumendb** is a simple client package for the [Lumen Database](http://lumendatabase.org/) (formerly Chilling Effects) [API](https://github.com/berkmancenter/lumendatabase/blob/master/doc/api_documentation.mkd). It can retrieve, as well as deposit, copyright takedown notices from the Lumen database. It may be useful for tracking who is sending copyright-related cease and desist orders and what material is being used in apparent violation of copyright.

All Lumen Database data [is released under to Public Domain (CC0)](https://www.lumendatabase.org/pages/license), though the API has additional [terms of use](https://lumendatabase.org/pages/api_terms).

## Installation ##

[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/lumendb)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=lumendb)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/lumendb.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/lumendb) 
[![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/leeper/lumendb/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/leeper/lumendb?branch=master)

This package is not yet on CRAN. To install the latest development version from GitHub, run the following:

```R
if(!require("devtools")){
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
}
install_github("leeper/lumendb")
```

Use of the package does not require an API token, though Lumen rate limits non-authenticated requests. To request a token, contact Lumen directly at: team (at) lumendatabase.org. The token should then be stored as an environment variable:

Sys.setenv(LUMEN_TOKEN = "t1o2k3e4n5v6a7l8u9e")

Or this can be passed atomically to every API call. Setting the environment variable is simpler and more secure because it will not be recorded in R history logs.

## Code Examples ##

[Documentation for the Lumen Database API is available on GitHub](https://github.com/berkmancenter/lumendatabase/blob/dev/doc/api_documentation.mkd). This may be useful, particularly for those interested in conducting [complex full-text API searches](https://github.com/berkmancenter/lumendatabase/blob/dev/doc/api_documentation.mkd#search-notices-via-fulltext).

```R
library("lumendb")
```

Coming soon...
